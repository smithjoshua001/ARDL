# ARDL
Adaptive Robotics Dynamics Library

Currently heavy WIP, built using CMake with dependencies of Eigen, fmt, spdlog, urdfdom, urdfdom_headers, assimp, ccd, fcl, and json11, rapidjson. Trajectory part requires pagmo, as well along with https://github.com/smithjoshua001/motion-generators.
Further improvements, features and refinements will be added shortly.
